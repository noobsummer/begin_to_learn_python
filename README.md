# begin_to_learn_python

Today is 2018/6/8 and I am going to learn python in 30 days. 
I only have a very very basic idea about coding before.
The mean purpose for me to learn python is to do data wrangling and quantitative trading.
BTW the reference book I use is called Data Wrangling with Python.
Let's begin together!
